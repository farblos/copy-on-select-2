Licensing Details
=================

This project uses three different licenses:

- MPL 2.0 without copyleft exceptions (SPDX:
  MPL-2.0-no-copyleft-exception) for the files inherited from the
  original add-on and files derived from those.  Which are:

    copy-on-select-2.png (removed without replacement)
    copy-on-select-2.svg
    src/copy-on-select-128.png (replaced by copy-on-select-2.svg)
    src/copy-on-select.js
    src/manifest.json

  The original add-on and its files are distributed under MPL 1.1
  but without any license headers whatsoever.  Such sources can
  be upgraded to MPL 2.0, but only without copyleft exceptions.

- Unlicense (SPDX: Unlicense) for files related to the release
  process.

  The motivation here is that it should be possible to reuse
  these in other projects with as little constraints as possible.

- Regular MPL 2.0 (SPDX: MPL-2.0) for all others.

All files come with appropriate clear-text license headers and
are in addition marked with SPDX tags according to the REUSE
specification (https://reuse.software/spec).  The license files
for all used licenses are available in directory LICENSES.
