# copy-on-select-2 - A Productivity Tool Which Copies Selected Text to the Clipboard Automatically

Are you used to being able to highlight text and have it
instantly copied to the clipboard?  Why not have this
functionality in your browser as well?

This is a fork of
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-on-select by
late
[spyrosoft](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/5778000).
Compared to the original add-on, the metadata of this add-on has
been modified to extent its scope also to file-based URLs.

The strength of this add-on is its extreme simplicity (8 lines of
code only!): Whenever you raise a mouse button, the current
selection, if any, is copied to the clipboard.  As you might have
guessed, that simplicity comes at a cost: This add-on works
reliably only in the most basic scenario, namely when copying
text from a web page.

Much more feature-complete, probably even feature-bloated, is
[AutocopySelection2Clipboard](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autocopyselection2clipboard),
but that disappeared from AMO in early 2022.
